QUIZ C1W1
==========

> 1. What does the analogy “AI is the new electricity” refer to?<br><br>
_**Similar to electricity starting about 100 years ago, AI is transforming multiple industries.**_

---

> 2. Which of these are reasons for Deep Learning recently taking off? (Check the three options that apply.)<br><br>
_**We have access to a lot more data.**_<br>
_**We have access to a lot more computational power.**_<br>
_**Deep learning has resulted in significant improvements in important applications such as online advertising, speech recognition, and image recognition.**_

---

> 3. Recall this diagram of iterating over different ML ideas. Which of the statements below are true? (Check all that apply.)<br><br>
_**Faster computation can help speed up how long a team takes to iterate to a good idea.**_
_**Being able to try out ideas quickly allows deep learning engineers to iterate more quickly.**_
_**Recent progress in deep learning algorithms has allowed us to train good models faster (even without changing the CPU/GPU hardware).**_

---

> 4. When an experienced deep learning engineer works on a new problem, they can usually use insight from previous problems to train a good model on the first try, without needing to iterate multiple times through different models. True/False?<br><br>
_**False**_

---

> 5. Which one of these plots represents a ReLU activation function?<br><br>
_**ReLU Graph**_

---

> 6. Images for cat recognition is an example of “structured” data, because it is represented as a structured array in a computer. True/False?<br><br>
_**False**_

---

> 7. A demographic dataset with statistics on different cities' population, GDP per capita, economic growth is an example of “unstructured” data because it contains data coming from different sources. True/False?<br><br>
_**False**_

---

> 8. Why is an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) used for machine translation, say translating English to French? (Check all that apply.)<br><br>
_**It is applicable when the input/output is a sequence (e.g., a sequence of words).**_
_**It can be trained as a supervised learning problem.**_

---

> 9. In this diagram which we hand-drew in lecture, what do the horizontal axis (x-axis) and vertical axis (y-axis) represent?<br><br>
_**x-axis is the amount of data**_
_**y-axis (vertical axis) is the performance of the algorithm.**_

---

> 10. Assuming the trends described in the previous question's figure are accurate (and hoping you got the axis labels right), which of the following are true? (Check all that apply.)<br><br>
_**Increasing the size of a neural network generally does not hurt an algorithm’s performance, and it may help significantly.**_
_**Increasing the training set size generally does not hurt an algorithm’s performance, and it may help significantly.**_
